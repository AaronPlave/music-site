TODO List

-creating users:
	-if new user, click sign up, login through google or fb, redirect to edit user page
	-if user not new, just login
-put css things into a css stylesheet, scripts into a scripts sheet, etc
-Create all the error views
-Work out the database models more
-Work out privacy system for User-User contact and who can see what (location, full name, email,etc.)
-Sessions
-profile pictures -- either none at all, just facebook grabbing and have google users (who don't usually have an image actually) just have none, default (wes + jam images) or upload a new one.
-Fix that damn edit profile
-Cache pages
-Styling..
-Autocomplete for searches
-data optimizations for mobile, maybe hide soundcloud on initial page load, have button to load soundclouds.
-add support for selection of field in search initially?

FUTURE:
-If expanded from Wes, either add groups (like Wes, CCM, etc.) or Google Maps API for general location search. 
-Art deco fonts
